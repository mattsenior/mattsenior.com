<p>I often get asked which responsive grid system I use. This is a very frustrating question because it implies a requirement where I have none. With the myriad solutions presented I can&#8217;t blame people for thinking they have a choice to make.</p>
<p>This article is my response to that question.</p>
<h2>Anatomy of a grid system—if that is something that is—then hello</h2>
<p>Responsive grid systems can be broken into two main parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>A CSS construct for the basic grid cell/unit</li>
<li>A catch-all methodology to cover generic column layout</li>
</ol>
<p>Most systems I see feature a largely trivial decision around part #1 and a load of nonsense for part #2 — in my opinion. I don&#8217;t mean to insult those who attempt this. Many smart minds have produced very interesting results worth studying. I call it nonsense because overcomplicating the problem will always produce crazy complex solutions. I believe this comes down to a desire to abstract code too far.</p>
<p>This is how I handle responsive layout:</p>
<h3>Part 1 — the basic unit</h3>
<p>There are numerous ways to achieve this. The principle is to align elements as columns with an even gutter between them. Here&#8217;s a five-column example:</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be worried if that surprised you but illustrations make a long article look nice. From <a href="/2012/03/27/introducing-shiro/">experimentation last year</a> I&#8217;ve been using this CSS construct ever since:</p>

<pre><code>
var postmark = require("postmark")("YOURAPIKEY");
postmark.send({
    "From": "donotreply@example.com", 
    "To": "target@example.us", 
    "Subject": "Test", 
    "TextBody": "Test Message"
});
</code></pre>
