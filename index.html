This means that a container like this one will <a href="/article">inherit its style from the body</a> of the document. Something else really should go here to make sure we end up on another line.</p>

            <p>Using containers without classes added is a <strong>great way to test the same styles across many pieces of <em>different</em> content</strong> on your canvas.</p>

            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. <a href="#">Richard McClintock</a>, a Latin professor at <a href="#">Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia</a>, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.<p>

            <pre><code>
var postmark = require("postmark")("YOURAPIKEY");
postmark.send({
    "From": "donotreply@example.com", 
    "To": "target@example.us", 
    "Subject": "Test", 
    "TextBody": "Test Message"
});

            <p>Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The <a href="/article">first line</a> of Lorem Ipsum, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet…”, comes from a line in section 1.10.32. Which is far more intelligent?</p>
